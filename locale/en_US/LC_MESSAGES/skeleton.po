"Although the skeleton mod demonstrates a lot of basic core functionality, "
"and a reasonable way to construct a module, the phpwebsite core is really "
"very sophisticated and flexible. If I were to attempt to show everything "
"possible in this one module, it would just get confusing :) Please spend "
"some time reading the stuff in /docs/ as well as look through the skeleton "
"mod code. Also, skim through the code in some of the other mods, such as "
"blog and calendar and so on."

"I have tried to demonstrate simple and basic uses of many of the methods for "
"developing a phpwebsite module. Skeletons and bones are pretty straight "
"forward item classes. Bones relate to skeletons. Skeletons use the core Key "
"class. This enables lots of things like being able to use the Search class "
"as well as Categories and easy Menu tools. The list views show the basics of "
"using the DBPager class. Skeletons and bones demonstrate how to integrate a "
"File Cabinet file manager. Skeletons are restricted to images and Bones are "
"wide open. Be sure to check out the ease of use of the Link, Text, Form, "
"Settings, Permissions and Layout classes for building intelligent and rich "
"user experiences."
