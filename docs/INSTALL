INSTALL steps for skeleton

IMPORTANT: skeleton is a module for phpWebSite 1.6.0 or better.
 You HAVE to install phpWebSite >= 1.6.0 first, skeleton will
not work with earlier versions of phpWebSite.

If you don't have phpWebSite installed, first get the latest code here: 
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL.txt included
in the docs directory of that download.

Once this is done then you can start installing skeleton:

1. Download the .tar.gz from a sourceforge mirror.  (There is also a
   .zip file for windows users.)

2. Unpack the tarball with:
    tar -xvzf module-skeleton-*.tar.gz

3. Move the new directory into your phpwebsite mod directory

    Example: If you are installing skeleton and your
    phpwebsite doc root is /home/username/public_html, you could run
    
    mv skeleton /home/username/public_html/mod/skeleton

4. Go to your phpwebsite control panel and install skeleton from Boost.
