Hello {NAME},

Your internship has not been approved and enrollment is not complete.

As a result, your financial aid can be negatively impacted if you are not
registered for the course before Drop/Add closes on {CENSUS_DATE}.

If you intend for this internship to go forward for this semester, you need to
have the entire approval process completed no later than 12:00 noon on {CENSUS_DATE},
the last day of the Drop/Add period. This is to ensure registration can be completed
before the close of business.

You may NOT report to your internship site until you are fully registered! If
this internship needs to be canceled, please notify your departmental
internship coordinator.
