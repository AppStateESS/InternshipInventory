Internship Inventory is a sleek, intunitive, and powerful web-application for tracking and approving student internships in a higher-education setting. It is created and maintained by the core team of [Electronic Student Services](http://ess.appstate.edu) at [Appalachian State University](http://www.appstate.edu) and other contributers.

## Purpose
Internship Inventory helps a Univeristy track internships campus-wide. We specifically care about:
* Where each student is located during their internship (because of [State Authorization](http://wcet.wiche.edu/focus-areas/policy-and-regulation/state-authorization) and in case of emergency)
* Who we should contact in case of emergency
* Generating and storing a valid contract for each internship, to protect all parties (Student, Hosts, and the University) in case of legal dispute.

We've realized other benefits too:
* We have great data for reporting and data mining!
* Internships tend to get approved more quickly, or we have good notes on what happened otherwise.
* Fewer students and faculty members skip steps in the approval process. We catch errors before they become problems.
* Cut costs by streamlining the approval process (less man-hours) and saving paper.
