<h1>Skeleton</h1>
<h3>By Verdon Vaillancourt</h3>
<p>Skeleton allows you to build one or more skeletons with multiple bones relating to specific skeletons.</p>
<p>It is intended to be a demonstration module and could be used as the basis to start your own.</p>
<p>Skeleton demonstrates simple and basic uses of many of the methods for developing a phpwebsite module. Skeletons and bones are pretty straight forward item classes. Bones relate to skeletons. Skeletons use the core Key class. This enables lots of things like being able to use the Search class as well as Categories and easy Menu tools. The list views show the basics of using the DBPager class. Skeletons and bones demonstrate how to integrate a File Cabinet file manager. Skeleton is restricted to images and Bones is wide open. Be sure to check out the ease of use of the Link, Text, Form, Settings, Permissions and Layout classes for building intelligent and rich user experiences.</p>
<p>Although the skeleton mod demonstrates a lot of basic core functionality, and a reasonable way to construct a module, the phpwebsite core is really very sophisticated and flexible. If one were to attempt to show everything possible in this one module, it would just get confusing :) Please spend some time reading the stuff in /docs/ as well as look through the skeleton mod code. Also, skim through the code in some of the other mods, such as blog and calendar and so on.</p>
